<h3 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spotify</li>
<li>An internet connection</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Just goto to the <a href="https://github.com/SpotX-CLI/SpotX-Linux" target="_blank" ><strong>SpotX</strong></a>

 and run the bash command and for Windows use <a href="https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot" target="_blank" ><strong>BlockTheSpot</strong></a>

.
<strong>However,</strong> if you have installed Spotify from Microsoft Store, It would be uninstalled and the script would automatically install the latest official version from spotify.</p>
<p>So why wait? If you&rsquo;re tired of being interrupted by ads on Spotify, give SpotX a try and see for yourself how much better your music listening experience can be. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed!</p>
