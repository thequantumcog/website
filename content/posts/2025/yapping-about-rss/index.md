Recently I have gotten into self hosting. I thought it would be expensive and difficult to set up, but I was wrong. You can still host a lot of stuff even on small (and free) ec2 instances! So, I hosted my own password manager and RSS feed. I'll probably make a blog about password managers next!

**Getting back to the topic,** \
For the people who don't know what RSS is, it is a protocol which basically allows you to fetch blog content and read it in your own reader. You can also use it to aggregate your own sources of information instead of an algorithm choosing it for you. There are some Pros and Cons of getting your news this way but for me I prefer the algorithm-less experience. It allows me to choose what _I want_ and not what some corporate overload has choosen for me. Moreover, I also found some diverse and interesting topics while searching for rss feeds ðŸ˜‰ and I learnt about [ooh.directory](https://ooh.directory) which allowed me to find some really cool people.

Previously I used ReadYou on Android and NewsBoat on linux to catchup on my feeds but it was cumbersome. I couldn't sync starred entries and I had to change every setting twice on both sides. But now after my switch to miniflux, I am pretty happy. For web, I really liked [ReactFlux](https://reactflux.pages.dev) interface and on phone I just connected my server instance with Read You using Google Reader API.

I miss writing random things on this blog. So, I'll probably be posting more this summer. (no promises tho!)
