Social Media has changed drastically over the years.But the question is "Can you really trust these companies?". Decentralized social media apps and websites are gaining traction especially because of recent policy changes of social media apps such as Reddit and Twitter. Last Year, Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk and raised API prices and changed the platform for better or worse. Similarly, Reddit also increased its API prices. Decentralized Social Media such as Mastodon, Lemmy, and Kbin gained popularity due to this.
## Advantages
- Decentralized Social Media is not controlled by one single company or person rather you can make your own instance of social media and interact with others. Thus, you cannot be banned from such a platform.
- Decentralized Social Media is also harder to fully ban in a country because there are so many instances. If one instance is banned, you can use another.
- If you don’t like the policies of one instance you can choose a different instance of your liking.
## Disadvantages
- The main disadvantage of something like Lemmy is that it is harder to moderate because of bot accounts. 
- Fewer Users are present on these platforms.
